# Overview

**[Agent Based Modelling Assessment 1 GitHub repository](https://https://github.com/kweird/githubintro/)**

This is a collection of python and associated files that were written whilst taking the **[Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/)** course, they show the iterations and improvements made to a python project designed to be an introduction to Agent Based Modelling.

The course included a series of practicals, the code for each practical is included in an appropriately named sub folder, to show how the concepts and methods were taught and applied step by step. The final code has a graphical user interface (GUI) and creates an animation of various agents that wander round an environment eating from resources in the environment and sharing food with other agents, where the environment is created from data parsed from a webpage.

## Instructions

Download the repository from GitHub and run with python. Select run from the Run menu.

## Files

finalassessment.py - Final python code containing all the elements taught throughout the course.

agentframework.py - Separate python file containing the Agent class and various Agent related functions.

README.md - An overview of the code in the repository.

LICENSE - The program license, the **[MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)**

## Further development ideas

-Improve documentation.
-Create an easier way to adjust variables that affect the running of the code, such as number of agents and iterations etc. Command line arguments or via GUI.
-Add code to create an output file of all the results and important information when the code is run.
